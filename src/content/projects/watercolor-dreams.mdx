Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest artistic journey with you: "Watercolor Dreams." This collection marks my exploration into the world of digital watercolor art, where each piece is a personal reflection of my emotions and inspirations.

---

## Overview

"Watercolor Dreams" is a collection of my first digital watercolor drawings, each one unique and representative of my learning journey. These artworks are minted as 1 of 1 NFTs on **LoopExchange**, giving each piece rarity similar to owning an original painting.

You can explore the collection and purchase pieces on LoopExchange: **[Watercolor Dreams Collection](https://loopexchange.io/collections/watercolor-dreams)**.

## Tools of the Trade

I create my artwork using:

- An **11-inch iPad Air**
- **Apple Pencil Pro**
- **Procreate** as my primary software

The iPad's portability lets me paint wherever inspiration strikes, while Procreate offers incredible flexibility with colors, brushes, and undo options that allow me to refine my style with ease.

## My Creative Process

To keep my skills sharp, I aim to produce a new piece each week. Hereâ€™s a look at my process:

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Inspiration & Subject Choice**: My subjects are often inspired by my experiences and interests. For instance, _"Cob Classico"_ was inspired by a recent trip to Italy, while _"Apeâ€™s Delight"_ captures my ongoing interest in GameStop.

2. **Sketching & Templates**: I start with a rough sketch, sometimes inspired by templates or AI-generated ideas. This gives me a foundation to build upon.

3. **Styles & Techniques**: I use two main styles:

   - **Detailed Pencil Work**: Seen in pieces like _"Space Sentinel"_, emphasizing intricate linework.
   - **Shading & Blending**: As used in _"Cob Classico"_, where the focus is on soft shading and smooth transitions.

4. **Metadata & Naming**: I use AI to assist in naming my pieces and writing descriptions, with plans to include more detailed metadata, like creation dates and time spent.

5. **Minting & Listing**: Each piece is minted as a 1 of 1 NFT on **Loopring** and listed on **LoopExchange**. You can also find promotions and updates on my Twitter, [@cobmin](https://twitter.com/cobmin).

## Pricing & Commissions

I gradually increase the price of each new piece by 5-10 LRC. My latest piece sold for 50 LRC (~$7 USD). As demand grows and my skills improve, this incremental pricing strategy will continue.

Additionally, I'm open to custom commissions starting at 100 LRC. Reach out to me on Twitter for custom pieces!

## Future Plans

I plan to:

- Create a new piece each week
- Enrich metadata with creation dates, time logs, and additional details
- Expand my skillset by experimenting with new watercolor styles and techniques

## Conclusion

"Watercolor Dreams" is a growing reflection of my passion for art. Iâ€™m excited to share this journey with you and look forward to expanding the collection. For custom artwork, feel free to reach outâ€”let's create something unique together!

The **JacobHuber.me** website serves as both a personal portfolio and a blogging platform where I can showcase my projects, document my learning journey, and share insights on software development, specifically in **Next.js**, **shadcn/ui**, **Vercel**, and **Markdown**. The site is designed for both professional and personal content, using a clean and elegant layout with a dark mode option.

## Project Overview

The goal of **JacobHuber.me** is to provide an intuitive, visually appealing platform that showcases my professional projects and personal blog posts. It's built with performance, scalability, and ease of content management in mind.

Key features include:

- **Dynamic Content**: Blog and project sections are managed with Markdown files, allowing for easy content updates and rich text formatting.
- **Custom UI**: Built with shadcn/ui components for a modern and minimalist look.
- **Theme Toggle**: Dark and light mode toggle for a better user experience across different lighting conditions.

## Key Features

This project comes with several built-in features that enhance usability and performance:

### 1. Blogging and Projects with Markdown

The blog and projects sections are powered by Markdown files, which allow for easy, flexible content creation and management. The use of **MDX** (Markdown with JSX) enables the addition of custom components, making content more dynamic.

### 2. UI Components from shadcn/ui

By using shadcn/ui, I’ve built a sleek and accessible interface. Components like cards, buttons, and toggles are customized to fit the theme and overall aesthetic of the site.

### 3. Dark Mode

Dark mode is available site-wide and can be toggled easily, providing a user-friendly experience that adapts to individual preferences.
